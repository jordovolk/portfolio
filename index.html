                <p>As of right now, all the programs that are uploaded to the Programming-Examples Repository were made in my First Semester's Fundamentals of Programming class. In this class all code was written in Python. If you wish to check out some of the programs click on the image of the Github repository.</p>

                <p>My parents moved from Mankato, MN to Carver, MN after I was born. I have lived in the same house and neighborhood all my life. I was heavily involved in sports as a child through the end of Middle School. I attended Chaska Middle School West (CMSW) through 8th Grade and soon after I attended Chanhassen High School. During my High School years I wasn't involved in many extra curricular activities. School and work became my reality and hanging out with my friends was my primary use of free time. With High School being in the past, I look forward to expanding my horizons and moving out of my comfort zone to experience what life has to offer. </p>
                <p>Currently, I am attending <b>Hennepin Technical College</b> for an <b>AAS in .NET Programming</b> and I'm loving every minute of it. I have met many new people that are in similar career paths and it is awesome forming new relationships! I am still debating what other IT fields I am interested in but a Bachelor's in Computer Science might be where im headed after I finish my AAS. I was once advised if you are planning to do something it is best to put that idea in writing otherwise it is simply an idea, I am taking that advice and turning an idea into a plan. </p>
